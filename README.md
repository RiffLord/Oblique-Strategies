# Oblique Strategies

Oblique Strategies (Over One Hundred Worthwhile Dilemmas) is a card-based method devised by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt, first published in 1975; its purpose is to promote creativity and lateral thinking by offering constraints within which 
an artist should approach a particular work. Each card offers a single suggestion, aphorism or remark. They can be used as a pack, or by drawing a single card from the shuffled pack when faced with a dilemma in a given situation. Many editions have been released over the years, with variations on single strategies and differing numbers of cards. An attempt has been made to collect all of these within a single text file which represents the deck.

## Description

This implementation is a very basic Android app. The user swipes left on the screen to prompt the app to read a random line from the text file containing all of the cards' contents. They can also swipe right to view previously drawn cards.
