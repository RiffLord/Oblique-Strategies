# Oblique Strategies

Oblique Strategies (Over One Hundred Worthwhile Dilemmas) is a card-based method devised by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt, first published in 1975; its purpose is to promote creativity and lateral thinking by offering constraints within which 
an artist should approach a particular work. Each card offers a single suggestion, aphorism or remark. They can be used as a pack, or by drawing a single card from the shuffled pack when faced with a dilemma in a given situation. Many editions have been released over the years, with variations on single strategies and differing numbers of cards. An attempt has been made to collect all of these within a single text file which represents the deck.

## Description

This implementation is a very basic Android app. The user taps the screen to prompt the app to read a random line from the text file containing all of the cards' contents.


## Installation

Download & import the project into Android Studio click <b>Build > Build Bundle(s) / Build APK(s) > Build APK(s)</b>. Locate the APK file, copy it into the appropriate directory on your Android device & install.

### Bugs

The app is supposed to avoid re-drawing cards that were previously displayed if the user didn't draw more times than the number of cards in the deck (174 currently), however duplicates are occasionally drawn as seen in the Log messages which keep track of the numeric indexes of the cards.
